This answer works for only a scenario where your end target is to paste the copied buffer contents immediately.
The simplest way to do this is by splitting your screen into two regions. You can do this by hitting CTRL+a then 
|'This is not an i. It is the PIPE sign on your keyboard'
Hit CTRL+a then TAB to switch to the second region, CTRL+a then c to create a new session in the second region.
If you want to copy from nano and paste in terminal, open up the file in nano on the left region, hit CTRL+a then ESC, 
scroll to the start point of your copy location and hit SPACE, select the text by scrolling to the end point and hit SPACE again to mark copy. 
Now, all you have to do is hit CTRL+a then TAB to switch to the region on your right and hit CTRL+a then ].
Your text will be written out to the command line. Note that you can also check for hardcopy option if you want to write directly to file.


How to Select and Copy Text in screen Copy Mode:

    Enter Copy Mode:
        Press Ctrl-a then [ to enter copy mode. This will allow you to move the cursor using your keyboard.

    Move the Cursor to Start Point:
        Use the arrow keys to navigate the cursor to the beginning of the text you want to select.

    Begin Selection:
        Press the space bar to start the selection. This sets the starting point of the text you want to copy.

    Extend Selection:
        Move the cursor with the arrow keys to extend the selection to the end of the text you wish to copy.

    Copy the Text:
        Press the space bar again once you have highlighted the desired text. This copies the selected text to the screen clipboard.

    Exit Copy Mode:
        You can exit copy mode by pressing Enter or simply by pressing Ctrl-a then [ again.



Pasting Text:

    Paste the Copied Text:
        To paste the copied text within screen, you press Ctrl-a followed by ]. This will paste the copied text at the cursorâ€™s current location in any of the screen windows.


Plan:
Step 1: Finalize Submodule Changes

Before initializing and updating submodules in your main project, make sure each submodule repository is correctly set up and that all changes are committed:

    Navigate to Each Submodule Directory:

    bash

cd path/to/submodule

Check the Status and Commit Changes:
Inside each submodule, commit any changes that you want to keep:

bash

git add .
git commit -m "Update changes or fix issues"

Push Submodule Changes:
Still inside each submodule directory, push the changes to the respective remote repository:

bash

    git push origin master  # Or whichever branch you are on

Step 2: Initialize and Update Submodules in Main Repository

Once all individual submodules are updated and pushed, go back to your main project directory and update the submodules to ensure they are correctly linked and initialized:

    Navigate to Main Project Directory:

    bash

cd path/to/main/project

Initialize and Update Submodules:
This step will ensure that your local submodule references are initialized and updated:

bash

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Step 3: Stage and Commit Main Project Changes

After your submodules are set up and initialized, you can safely stage and commit changes in your main project:

    Stage Changes:
    If external/tartanair_tools or any other directories need to be converted to submodules and were incorrectly added, first unstage them:

    bash

git rm --cached path/to/wrongly-added-directory

Then add them correctly as submodules if necessary:

bash

git submodule add <repository-url> path/to/submodule

Commit Changes in Main Project:
Now you can safely add all changes and commit:

bash

git add .
git commit -m "Set up submodules and update project structure"

Push Main Project Changes:
Finally, push the changes of your main project to the remote repository:

bash

    git push origin master

Additional Notes:

    Submodule URLs: When adding submodules with git submodule add, you need to provide the URL of the repository you wish to add as a submodule.
    Avoid git add . Until Ready: Use git add . cautiously to avoid staging unwanted files or directories again.

GitHub Branches Cheat Sheet
====================================================

# Basics
- Branch: Separate line of development in Git.
- Master/Main: Default primary branch.

# Creating Branches
- Create and switch to a new branch:
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
- Create a new branch without switching:
  git branch <branch-name>

# Switching Branches
- Switch to an existing branch:
  git checkout <branch-name>

# Listing Branches
- List all branches:
  git branch

# Deleting Branches
- Delete a local branch:
  git branch -d <branch-name>
- Force delete a local branch:
  git branch -D <branch-name>

# Merging Branches
- Merge a branch into the current branch:
  git merge <branch-name>

# Pushing Branches to Remote
- Push a branch to remote repository:
  git push origin <branch-name>

# Tracking Remote Branches
- Set up a local branch to track a remote branch:
  git branch --track <local-branch> <remote-branch>

# Deleting Remote Branches
- Delete a remote branch:
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Checking Branch Info
- Show last commit on each branch:
  git branch -v
- Show branches merged into current branch:
  git branch --merged
- Show branches not merged into current branch:
  git branch --no-merged
